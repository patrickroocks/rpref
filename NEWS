rPref 1.1
=========


* Added lazyeval to imports-list

* Supports non-standard-evaluation (using lazyeval)
  for low_, high_, and true_ preferences
  
* Added Rgraphviz, ggplot2, rmarkdown and knitr to 
  suggests-list

* plot_btg uses Rgraphviz (if available) to plot
  Better-Than-Graphs
  
* Added levelwise parameter to plot_btg
  
* Added two vignettes (Introduction and Visualization)

* Fixed bug in top-k selection, when more than one
  top-parameter and "and_connected = FALSE" is given
  
* Added C++11 to SystemRequirements

* Substituted all usual pointers in the C++ Code
  by C++11 shared pointers
  (no more new/delete commands in the C++ code)

* Slightly optimized Scalagon Top-k algorithm

* Added option rPref.parallel.threads for specifying
  the number of threads for parallel computation
  
* Preferences can have associated data frames, see ?set.df

* Added pevel for preference selection using associated
  data frames
  
* Changed parameters of init_pred_succ for calculating
  predecessors/successors (old parametrization still works 
  with a warning)
  
* Renamed eval.pref to partial.eval.pref
